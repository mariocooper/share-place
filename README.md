# Share Place App
**Share Place** is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. This app allows users to sign up, log in, and log out. Users can share their favorite places with photos, descriptions, titles, and image uploads. The app provides authentication to ensure that only the user who shared a place can edit or delete it. Additionally, users can view places shared by each individual user by visiting their profiles. Each user has a name and photo associated with their account.

## Features
* User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely, ensuring their privacy and data security.

* Share Places: Users can share their favorite places by providing a title, description, and uploading an image. These shared places are displayed in the app for others to see.

* User Profiles: Each user has a profile where they can see the places they've shared. Users can also view other users' profiles to see the places they've shared.

* Edit and Delete Places: Users can edit and delete the places they've shared, maintaining control over their own content.

## Technologies Used
* MongoDB: Database to store user information, shared places and user profiles

* Node.js: Server runtime environment
